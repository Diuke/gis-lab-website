<h3>How to run locally:</h3>

To run this website in your own machine you will need to have a webserver installed an running on your machine, we recomend XAMPP for Windows, and Apache for Linux.

Steps to have the website in your local machine:

1 - Clone the repository or download it as zip.

2 - If your files are not already in the htdocs folder of your webserver, put them there. They must be inside a folder called *gis-lab-website* for the links to work.

3 - Start your webserver and navigate to http://localhost/gis-lab-website (in case your webserver is in a port different than 80, specify it)
